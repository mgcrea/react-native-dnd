# {frontmatter.title}

`DndProvider` is a React component that sets up the Drag and Drop context (`DndContext`) for its children components.

It provides the necessary state and logic for draggable and droppable components.

## Usage

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { DndProvider } from "path/to/DndProvider";
import type { FunctionComponent } from "react";

export const App: FunctionComponent = () => {
  return <DndProvider>{/* Render draggable and droppable components */}</DndProvider>;
};
```

## Props

`DndProvider` component accepts the following props:

<Properties>
  <Property name="springConfig" type="WithSpringConfig" optional defaultValue={`{}`}>
    An optional spring configuration object to be used for animating the dragged item back to its initial

  </Property>
  <Property name="activationDelay" type="number" optional defaultValue={`0`}>
    An optional number representing the duration, in milliseconds, of the LongPress gesture before Pan is
    allowed to activate. If the finger is moved during that period, the gesture will fail. Default is `0`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="minDistance" type="number" optional defaultValue={`0`}>
    An optional number representing minimum distance the finger (or multiple finger) need to travel before the
    gesture activates. Expressed in points.

    feedback.
  </Property>
  <Property name="onDragEnd" type="function" optional>
    A callback function to be called when a drag event ends. It receives an object with `active` and `over`
    properties representing the active draggable item options and the droppable item options that the draggable
    item is over, respectively.
  </Property>
